How Does the Student Attendance System Operate?
The Simple Student Attendance System operates as a straightforward application that doesn't require user login for accessing its primary features and functionalities. 
Instructors can effortlessly compile a list of classes they teach, along with the names of students in each class. For initial use, instructors need to populate the list of classes and students before managing attendance and generating reports.
Within the Attendance Form, users are prompted to initially select the class and date before the system lists all the students. Users can then easily check the attendance status for each student. 
The form includes a convenient "Check/Uncheck All" feature for each attendance status, allowing users to mark or unmark all listed student attendance with a single click.
If the form is submitted with any unmarked attendance status, it will display a message and halt the submission of attendance data.
